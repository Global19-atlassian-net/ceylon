BLOCK LEVEL THINGS


   Paragraphs

        A short paragraph of text.

        A second short paragraph this one is hard wrapped though.

        Another paragraph of text that is really, honestly, too long not to
        wrap I wonder what will happen?

        And finally, here's a paragraph  of text   with extra          spaces


   Numbered lists

        1. Numbered list,

        2. Another item that is really, honestly, too long not to wrap I wonder
           what will happen?

        3. A paragraph item,

        4. Another paragraph  item!


   Bulleted lists

        And now...

        * A bulleted list,

        * Another item that is really, honestly, too long not to wrap I wonder
          what will happen?

        * A paragraph item,

        * Another paragraph  item!


   Blockquotes

        > A block quote that is really, honestly, too long not to wrap I wonder
        > what will happen?

        and...

        > a block quote that is hard wrapped


   Code blocks

        Here's a code block:

        public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        }

    
                                      * * *


   Mix it up

        * A list item with a blockquote:
        
          > This is a blockquote inside a list item.
        
        * And let's try a 
          * nested list
