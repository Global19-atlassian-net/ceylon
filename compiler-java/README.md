Directory structure
-------------------

* `bin`       - the Ceylon tools binaries
* `lib`       - compile/runtime dependencies

Build the compiler and tools
----------------------------

For setting up the development environment and compiling and building the distribution
take a look at [ceylon-dist](https://github.com/ceylon/ceylon-dist#ceylon-distribution).

If after having built the distribution you want to build and test the compiler
return to `ceylon-compiler` and run

    ant clean publish
    
To run the tests type

    ant test

Note that some of the tests currently fail. See more info in README.tests.

Once built, the compiler lives in this jar:

    ~/.ceylon/repo/org/eclipse/ceylon/compiler/java/X.Y.Z/org.eclipse.ceylon.compiler.java-X.Y.Z.jar

If you want to build and run the Ceylon compiler in Eclipse
then please see README.eclipse for setup instructions.

Running the compiler
--------------------

For help on the usage of the ceylon compiler you can either type

    ceylon help compile
    
or you can go to the online documentation for [ceylon compile](http://www.ceylon-lang.org/documentation/current/reference/tool/ceylon/subcommands/ceylon-compile.html)

Building the project on Mac with JDK7
-------------------------------------

1) Download JDK7: http://jdk7.java.net/download.html

2) Unpack .dmg

3) export JAVA_HOME

    Skywalker:ceylon-compiler alesj$ export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_08.jdk/Contents/Home/

    Skywalker:ceylon-compiler alesj$ java -version
    java version "1.7.0_06-ea"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_06-ea-b12)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.2-b03, mixed mode)

4) Build it (ant clean publish)

    publish:
        [copy] Copying 2 files to /Users/alesj/.ceylon/repo/org/eclipse/ceylon/compiler/java/0.6
        [copy] Copying 2 files to /Users/alesj/.ceylon/repo/org/eclipse/ceylon/ant/0.6

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
